# room-booking-bootstrap-terraform

Creates the shared S3 bucket that the other `room-booking-*` projects use as
Terraform remote state storage, so state isn't kept only on one person's
laptop and everyone applying Terraform reads/writes the same state.

## First-time setup

Run once, with AWS credentials for the target account active:

```
./deploy.sh
```

This creates a bucket named `remote-state-<aws-account-id>` (e.g.
`remote-state-431071856068`) and prints its name at the end.

### How `deploy.sh` avoids the chicken-and-egg problem

This project's own state needs to live in the bucket it creates, same as
every other project — but on the very first run, that bucket doesn't exist
yet, so Terraform can't initialise an S3 backend pointed at it. `deploy.sh`
handles this in three steps:

1. It first tries `terraform init -backend-config=backend.hcl -migrate-state
   -force-copy`. On a fresh checkout this fails (the bucket doesn't exist),
   so it falls back to a plain local `terraform init`.
2. `terraform apply` runs against that local state, creating the bucket.
3. It runs the backend-config init again. The bucket now exists, so this
   succeeds and copies the local state into it, under the key
   `bootstrap/terraform.tfstate` in the same bucket every other project uses.

From then on, `deploy.sh` is idempotent: both init attempts just reconnect to
the already-migrated remote state, so re-running it behaves like any other
project's `deploy.sh`.

We deliberately did **not** commit `terraform.tfstate` to git as a way around
this. It would have worked, but state files are merge-hostile, and while
today's state (an S3 bucket and its access/encryption settings) has nothing
secret in it, that stops being true the moment this project grows — and
committing it would leave this one project without the locking that
`use_lockfile` gives everything else. Migrating into the bucket keeps this
project consistent with the rest instead of a special case.

A leftover local `deploy/terraform/terraform.tfstate` file remains after the
migration (Terraform doesn't delete the source state) — it's stale, is
already covered by `.gitignore`, and can be deleted or left alone.

The bucket has `prevent_destroy` set, so a stray `terraform destroy` here
can't take out every project's state in one go. To genuinely decommission
it, remove that lifecycle block first.

## Configuring other projects to use remote state

Each `room-booking-*` project's `deploy/terraform/` directory has:

- A `backend "s3" {}` block (empty) in `versions.tf`, declaring that the
  project uses an S3 backend without hardcoding the details.
- A checked-in `backend.hcl` file supplying the parts that don't change per
  deploy:

  ```hcl
  bucket       = "remote-state-431071856068"
  region       = "us-east-1"
  use_lockfile = true
  ```

- Scripts (`deploy.sh`, `undeploy.sh`, `authenticate.sh`) that pass `key`
  on the command line instead, computed from the **environment** being
  deployed (see the [room-booking project README](https://github.com/geoffweatherall/room-booking#multi-environment-deployments)
  for the full multi-environment design):

  ```
  terraform init -backend-config=backend.hcl -backend-config="key=<environment>/<project-name>/terraform.tfstate"
  ```

  giving a layout like `test/room-booking-api/terraform.tfstate`,
  `production/room-booking-webapp/terraform.tfstate`, or
  `bob/room-booking-api/terraform.tfstate` for a developer's personal sandbox.

`backend.hcl` isn't secret — it just says which bucket to read and write
state from — so it's committed to git rather than ignored.

If the state bucket ever changes (e.g. a new AWS account), update the
`bucket` value in each project's `backend.hcl` and re-run `terraform init`
with the same `-backend-config` flags plus `-reconfigure`.

### Adding a new project

Give it its own `<project-name>` segment in the `key` passed by its scripts
(e.g. `<environment>/<project-name>/terraform.tfstate`) so its state doesn't
collide with another project's in the shared bucket.

## Locking

State locking uses Terraform's native S3 lockfile support (`use_lockfile =
true`), not a DynamoDB table. This requires Terraform >= 1.10 (all projects'
`versions.tf` require this). When two people (or the same person twice)
attempt `apply` against the same state key concurrently, the second one
blocks/fails until the first finishes.

## Why no bucket versioning

Versioning was deliberately left off to keep this simple/cheap. This means
there's no built-in way to recover a previous version of the state file if
it's overwritten or corrupted — if that risk matters later, versioning can be
turned on by adding an `aws_s3_bucket_versioning` resource in `s3.tf`.
